## Description
The Weather Dashboard is a simple weather application that allows a user to search for a city and get the current weather and 5-day forecast for that city. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and a third-party API, OpenWeatherMap API, that allows access to weather data with specfic parameters to the URL - in this case, cities and 5-day forecast.

## Usage
The user can utilize the Weather Dashboard app to search for a specific city's current weather and 5-day forecast. The dashboard allows the user to prepare for an event, travel, or every day errand by providing them with an outlook on the weather and future weather. When the user inputs a city, the city will be saved into local storage and appear underneath the search bar if they wish to go back to their previously searched cities. If the user would like to clear their previously searched cities, they can simply click the 'trash can' button - this will clear their search from local storage.

Moment.js was used to create the time responsiveness in the page. OpenWeatherMap API was used to access weather data in cities. In addition to the above, the dynamic CSS code is powered by Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Google fonts.
